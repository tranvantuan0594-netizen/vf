# 🔄 VinFast Dashboard - Status Update

**Status:** ✅ **Active** (January 2026)
**X-HASH:** Resolved
**Current Limitation:** SOH Data Not Available

---

## 📖 Current Status

### ✅ Dashboard is Back Online!

The X-HASH authentication issue has been resolved. The dashboard is now fully functional.

### ⚠️ Important Limitation: No SOH Data

The **State of Health (SOH)** battery data is **no longer returned** by the VinFast API. This means:

- Battery health percentage is not available
- Battery degradation tracking is not possible
- Only basic telemetry data (SOC, range, charging status) is available

This appears to be a change on VinFast's side.

## 🔐 X-HASH Authentication

### Background

In January 2026, VinFast implemented **X-HASH authentication** for their connected car APIs:

- Dynamic HMAC-SHA256 signatures
- Request-specific hash calculation
- Per-request timestamp validation

### Resolution

The authentication mechanism has been analyzed and implemented:

- ✅ Hash algorithm identified
- ✅ Authentication implemented in dashboard
- ✅ API access restored

---

## 🔍 Research Findings

During the X-HASH investigation, we:

✅ **Discovered 39 unique API endpoints**
✅ **Analyzed 124 API request logs**
✅ **Documented complete API patterns**
✅ **Identified X-HASH algorithm (HMAC-SHA256)**
✅ **Implemented authentication mechanism**
✅ **Created Postman collections for 3 regions**

### X-HASH Analysis Results:

| Discovery           | Details                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Hash Pattern**    | 92.6% timestamp-dependent, 7.4% body-dependent |
| **Algorithm**       | Base64(HMAC-SHA256)                            |
| **Constant Hashes** | 0% - All dynamic                               |
| **Status**          | ✅ Resolved                                    |

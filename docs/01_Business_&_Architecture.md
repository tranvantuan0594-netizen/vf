# VinFast Dashboard - Business & Architecture Specification

**Version:** 3.0
**Status:** UPDATED
**Date:** Feb 2026

---

## 1. Business Context & Goals

### 1.1 Executive Summary

This project aims to build a modern, high-performance web dashboard for VinFast vehicle owners. Current native mobile apps can be slow or limited in providing deep technical insights. This dashboard acts as a "Digital Twin" monitor, offering real-time, detailed telemetry that empowers owners to understand their vehicle's health and status instantly.

### 1.2 Key Business Objectives

- **BO-01 (Speed)**: Reduce the time-to-check critical status (Battery, Range, Charging) to **< 2 seconds**.
- **BO-02 (Depth)**: Provide "Deep Scan" metrics (SOH, cell voltage, 12V status) that are hidden or hard to access in the native app.
- **BO-03 (Accessibility)**: Enable access via any web browser (Desktop/Tablet) without requiring a mobile device.

## 2. Solution Architecture

### 2.1 Technology Stack

**Modernized Serverless Architecture (Jan 2026).**

#### Frontend & Core: Astro 5.0 + React

- **Role**: Unified Application Shell & API Proxy.
- **Strategy**: "Islands Architecture" (Static shell + Interactive React Islands) + Server-Side Rendering (SSR).
- **Key Libs**: TailwindCSS (Utility Styling), Nano Stores (State Management).

#### API Layer: Serverless Proxy (Astro API Routes)

- **Role**: Reverse Proxy for VinFast API & Auth.
- **Infrastructure**: Primary on **Cloudflare Pages** (Edge), with 6 backup proxies (4x Vercel Serverless + 2x CF Workers) for 429 failover.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - **CORS Resolution**: Proxies requests from the browser to VinFast APIs to bypass CORS restrictions.
  - **429 Failover**: On rate-limit, shuffles through backup proxies (different egress IPs) until success. See [Proxy Failover docs](./api/PROXY_FAILOVER.md).
  - **Security**: Hides Auth0 Client interaction details, X-HASH signing secrets, and sanitized headers.

#### External Integrations (Client-side)

- **Open-Meteo**: Weather retrieval based on GPS coordinates.

#### Hybrid Shell Strategy

To prevent SSR runtime errors on certain edge runtime versions, the root routes are **Prerendered (Static Shell)**:

1. **Static HTML**: The layout shell is served as a static asset.
2. **Client Component**: `DashboardApp.jsx` handles the dynamic "Inside" logic only after mounting in the browser.
3. **Smooth Transition**: Prevents `[object Object]` rendering and flickering during auth redirects.

- **Nominatim (OSM)**: Reverse geocoding (Lat/Long -> City/Country).

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

### 3.1 Performance

- **NFR-PERF-01**: **Time to Interactive (TTI)** must be < 1.0 second on 4G networks.
- **NFR-PERF-02**: Dashboard data freshness: **real-time via MQTT** (sub-second). First data ~500ms after connect.

### 3.2 Security

- **NFR-SEC-01**: Tokens stored as HttpOnly cookies (server-side). All communication via HTTPS/WSS.
- **NFR-SEC-02**: All client-server communication must use HTTPS/WSS.

### 3.3 Reliability

- **NFR-REL-01**: System must gracefully handle API failures (See _Fallback Strategy_ in Functional Spec).
- **NFR-REL-02**: High availability via Edge deployment (Cloudflare).

---

### 2.3 Deployment Model

The system is optimized for **Manual CLI Deployment** to Cloudflare Pages.

- **Tools**: Wrangler CLI, Vite/Astro Build.
- **Method**: Direct Upload of the `dist` folder.
- **Reliability**: Uses a "Nuke Build" strategy (Clearing `dist` and `.wrangler`) to ensure fresh deployments.
